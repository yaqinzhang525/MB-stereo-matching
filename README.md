# MB-stereo-matching
MB-stereo-matching is a non-local cost aggregation stereo matching algorithm，which depends on minimum branching[1]
(a directed version of minimum spanning tree). we use Tarjan‘s method[2] to construct minimum branching, and the process of construction can segment an image to fragments, which helps us to distinguish the texture and textless region of the image.

**Environment:**

visual studio 2013 in windows

**experimental result：**

We test the algorithm on Middlebury Stereo including 2005,2006 and 2014 version and real scene, and receive better results than non-local[3] and ST method [4].
**2014 Dataset result:**

The second column is segment result relaized by our own method, and the following columns in trun are groundtruth, ours, non-local and ST.
